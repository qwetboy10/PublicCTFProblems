_dl_fixup



before _dl_lookup_symbol
change undef_name to v2 fixes it
set {char}($rdi+0xa) = '2'



set undef_name = "get_flag_v2"
set $rsi = 0x4f69eb45 # hash
# ignoring ref for now, i think that is only used in check_match
# ignoring current_value bc it is an out variable
# ignoring scope as i think that should always be the same
# ignore start bc we only have one library
# ignore version bc we aren't using symbol versioning
# ignore flags bc it is used in check_match only
# let skip_map stay null
# both are functions so type_class shouldn't change
# undef map is just the same as *scope->r_list

do_lookup_x

i is the index in symtab we are currently looking at
symtab and strtab dont changeo

map represents a dynamic library?

libc is the first, lib_v2 is the second

by doing those two changes we get to check_match
